# Dockerizing-ML-Application
This project demonstrates how to containerize a Machine Learning Workflow using Docker.

The given ML Classification model predicts the likelihood of a brain stroke using demographic and clinical features such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, and smoking status, which are known to influence cerebrovascular health.

The environment is fully containerized using Docker to ensure reproducibility, portability, and consistency across development and deployment stages.
